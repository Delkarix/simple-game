# Simple Game
This game was made as a simple demo to play with SDL3. It's a generic shoot-em-up with a basic square playermodel and basic square enemies.

It contains a rudimentary hand-written text-display system based on hardcoded bitmasking instead of using SDL TTF/RTF.

This version is a ground-up rewrite in Zig using much more advanced systems that are more similar to traditional gamedev, particularly to encourage emergent gameplay/programming.
This is partially in preparation for the development of future games.

Controls are simple:
* W: Forward
* A: Left
* S: Down
* D: Right
* Q: Quit
* Escape: Pause
* Left-Click: Fire

Move mouse to aim.
