# Simple Game
This game was made as a simple demo to play with SDL3. It's a generic shoot-em-up with a basic square playermodel and basic square enemies.

It contains a rudimentary hand-written text-display system based on hardcoded bitmasking instead of using SDL TTF/RTF.
A more improved version will be made in the future using OpenCL for improved graphics capabilities.

The code may be a bit messy in some places at the moment as the project was initially supposed to be a small prototype but ended up growing rather large as I kept adding features.

Controls are simple:
* W: Forward
* A: Left
* S: Down
* D: Right
* Q: Quit
* Escape: Pause
* Left-Click: Fire

Move mouse to aim.
